2D VECTORS

vector = magnitude + direction

sin(theta) = opposite/hypot
cos(theta) = adjacent/hypot
tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent

Using sin and cos, we can derive the x and y components of a vector
If you calculated x and y components, you can use pythagorean's theorem to recalculate the hypot
Calculate angle is atan2(y, x)

Adding and subtracting - Just extract the x and y components, add or subtract them

1D kinematics

For 1D, we can just pad our 2D vector class like this:
position = Vector2Math(12, x=0, y=0)
velocity = Vector2Math(12, x=5, y=0)  # 5 m/s along x
acceleration = Vector2Math(12, x=2, y=0)  # 2 m/s² along x

Concept:
Displacement is the vector from start point with the direction
Velocity is vector of displacement/time in a direction displacement per time unit
Acceleration is vector of velocity/time in a direction velocity change per time unit
Constant velocity = 0 acceleration
